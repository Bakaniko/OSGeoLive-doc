Manipulating Data with Osmosis
===============================


Manipulating Data
-----------------

4)  Osmosis
Not exactly an export tool, osmosis is a very powerful command-line tool for processing raw OpenStreetMap data.  You can extract data you want, merge data together, and many other tasks.  Osmosis can be used to import data into a database much like osm2pgsql and imposm, but it is included separately because it provides many other functions.

Advantages:  Incredibly powerful tool for manipulating OSM XML data.  Can be used to process and select data that you are interested.

Disadvantages:  Doesnâ€™t export to other formats.  Mainly useful for programmers who want to get deep into OSM.
