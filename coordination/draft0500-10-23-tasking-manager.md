Tasking Manager
===============

In the previous chapter, we looked at various ways to ensure quality
when contributing to OpenStreetMap.  In this section, we will take a
look at the HOT Tasking Manager, a tool that mappers can use to sort an
area into a grid, and work together to map an area in an organized way.

The OSM Tasking Manager allows mappers throughout the world to assist in mapping a defined region with a minimum risk of overlapping work areas ( *software editing tools use the term **conflict** when two mappers attempt to save changes to the same object - their work has overlapped* ). They can select an individual square, and complete the required mapping, marking the square as complete when they have done so. A second mapper, possibly more experienced, then checks the mapping within the square, and if they are satisfied marks the square as "Validated". 

To see how the tasking manager works, let’s take a closer look.

-   Open your Internet browser and go to
    [tasks.hotosm.org](http://tasks.hotosm.org). You will see a page
    like this:

![Tasking Manager Login][]

-   Click “login to OpenStreetMap \>\>”
-   Here you are agreeing to allow this application some access to your
    OpenStreetMap account.  Click “Save Changes.”

For information about the Tasking Manager, HOT sponsors partners & help links click on **About** in the red header banner.

![Tasking Manager About][]

The Task Manager initially displays in english - to change to another language click on "en" in the red header banner.

![Tasking Manager Languages][]

-   Now you will see the current list of projects, which may be sorted according to;  

 1. High Priority First
 2. Creation date, or
 3. Last update.

You can further refine your list by clicking in the **Your Projects** box, to see just the projects in which you have marked squares as complete, and/or you may use a free text search to locate tasks that contain particular text strings, such as **Ebola** (search is not case sensitive).

-   Click on a blue project title to see more information about that project.

![Job description][]

This page shows you everything you need to know about the project. On the left side of the page is a description of the mapping project and what is required. On the right side is a grid showing the area to be mapped;  
* Pink areas of the map indicate higher priority areas,  
* Yellow grid squares have been completed,  
* A yellow border indicates the square is being worked on now,  
* Green squares have been completed and “validated”, and the remaining squares still need to be mapped or are being worked on.  
By clicking on the “Instructions” tab, you can get information about how collaborators are meant to help map. There will be a section indicating the *Changeset comment* you should copy & paste into your editing programme when uploading your changes, together with the *source* information you may (depending on your editing software) need to copy & paste to the source field on making changes. Clicking on the “Activity” tab will show the activity within the task, and clicking the “Stats” tab will show a graph of progress & other information.  


![Picking a task][]

![Assigned task square][]

-   After you pick a square, here you see a view of the square that you
    are assigned to map. Click “Yes, I want to work on this task” to
    lock the square. You can automatically open the area for editing
    with JOSM, iD Editor, Potlatch 2, create a Walking Papers, or
    download the .osm / .gpx file.
-   If you plan to edit with JOSM, you need to open JOSM first with
    remote control setting enabled before you will be able to launch the
    application from the Tasking Manager.  To do this, open JOSM and go
    the Preferences menu.  Click on the “Remote Settings” tab and check
    the box next to “Enable remote control.”  Restart JOSM.

![Enabling JOSM Remote Control][]

-   Go back to the Tasking Manager and choose JOSM.  If you have JOSM
    open and you correctly enabled the remote control, the grid area of
    the map you selected will automatically be loaded into JOSM.

![Current data from the asigned task loaded JOSM][]

-   You may now edit the area using the instructions provided in the
    project information.  When you are finished, you can return to the
    tasking manager website and add comments about your changes.  Click
    “Mark task as done” to let other collaborators know that you have
    finished this grid square.  If you were unable to complete the task,
    click “Unlock it” to make it available again for other mappers.

![Marking task as done][]

![Adding comment to a completed task][]

-   If you are wondering what happens when you finish an area, the grid
    square will turn red on the map to indicate that is done.  Someone
    else will then look at your work to make sure it is good, and if
    they agree that you’ve completed the square well, the grid square
    will turn green, meaning it is complete!

Summary
------------------

The Tasking Manager can be quite useful for mapping an area rapidly and
ensuring completeness and data quality.  It can be quite helpful in
managing many various mappers both in one location and around the world.
