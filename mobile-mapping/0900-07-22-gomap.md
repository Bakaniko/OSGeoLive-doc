Go Map!!
===================

Go Map!! is an iOS app that lets you create and edit information in OpenStreetMap.
Go Map!! supports editing ways and arbitrary tagging.

You can download it for free from the App Store.

Getting Started
---------------

Setting the Background Display
-------------

Like using edit with iD or JOSM, Go Map!! allows us to use different background
that can guide us in editing data for OSM. You may select "Editor with Aerial" if
you want to use aerial imagery as the background for editing.

![Display][]

You also have the option to select what aerial imagery to use while editing.
By selecting "Aerial only", choose which imagery you wish to use.

![Custom Aerial][]

You may also add custom new aerial imagery by selecting "Add New" and enter the name and the
URL of the imagery on the URL text box. You need to define the tile servers and
max zoom for this imagery.

![Aerial Provider][]

Select "Clear Cache" if you want to clear the OSM data cache. Clearing the OSM
data cache is helpful especially if the application state becomes out of sync
with the OSM server. This may occur if someone else changes data you are editing,
or if one of your uploads fails midway through preventing from uploading
additional data.

Warning: Clearing the OSM cache will cause you to lose any changes that have not
yet been uploaded.

Clear the Mapnik or Overlay tile caches to download the latest tiles that reflect
changes you've previously submitted. Your changes may take up to 24 hours to be
processed.

![Clear Cache][]

You may also overlay different information such as GPX Tracks, Notes & Fixmes,
OpenStreetMap GPS Traces, and Unnamed Roads. Plus, you can enable rotation of the
app and enable 3-D effects of the OSM data.

![Overlays][]

Setting the Settings
-------------

Under the Settings icon, select OpenStreetMap login and type your OSM username
and password. If you don't have an OSM account, kindly select "Register new
account" and follow the instructions. Select "Verify" once you're done.

You may view the list of nearby mappers/ OSM users who edited the map data
shown in the map canvass.
