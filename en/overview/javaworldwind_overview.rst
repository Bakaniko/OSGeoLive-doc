Java World Wind
================================================================================


Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

World Wind is a set of Application Programming Interface (API) to display and interact with a virtual globe. 

Written in Java so as to be cross-platform and easy-to-use, World Wind allows developers to quickly and easily create interactive visualizations of 3 dimensional globe, map and geographical information.

World Wind provides a rich set of features for displaying and interacting with geographic data and representing a wide range of geometric objects.

Organizations across the world use World Wind to monitor weather patterns, visualize cities and terrain, track the movement of planes, vehicles and ships, analyze geospatial data, and educate people about the Earth.

In November 2009 was awarded NASA Software of the Year.  Since then it has developed a global community of users, from government, education, the non-profit sector, as well as private industry.
