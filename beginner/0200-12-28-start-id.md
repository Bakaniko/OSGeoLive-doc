The iD Web Editor
=============
The iD editor is the new (launched 2013) web-based OpenStreetMap editor which makes it easy to edit OpenStreetMap. iD is fast and easy, and allows you to map using various data sources such as satellite imagery, GPS, and Field Papers.

The iD editor is a great way to edit when you want to make small and easy changes, and you don't require all the complexity of JOSM.
