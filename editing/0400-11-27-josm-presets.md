JOSM Presets
============

### Add Presets

- If you have been given a file that should be added to the presets
  menu, you can add it now. For example, a presets file might be named
  something like buildings.xml.
- You should still have the Preferences window open. If you don’t,
  click Edit -\> Preferences to open the window.
- On the left side, click the icon that looks like a grid.

- Click the tab at the top that reads “Tagging Presets”.
- In the upper right, press the + button.
- Next to the second box on the right, click the button that looks
  like a folder. Navigate to the presets file you want to add, for
  example, buildings.xml.
- Click OK
