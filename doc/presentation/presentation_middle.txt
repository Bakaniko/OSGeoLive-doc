.. revealjs:: Desktop GIS
    .. rv_note::
        Let's start by reviewing Desktop GIS applications, where we find the heavy lifting applications. These applications cover the traditional GIS uses cases of viewing, editing and analysing geospatial data.

.. revealjs:: Browser Facing GIS
    .. rv_note::
        We will now look at browser-based clients. Browser clients are regularly used to publish maps, and increasingly being used to deliver a wide range of tools and functions previously only available in desktop applications.

.. revealjs:: Web Services
    .. rv_note::
        We'll now look at Web Services. Web Services are accessed via a URL, and return map data in various formats. Data is primarily accessed via OGC standards-based interfaces, including Web Map Services for images, Web Feature Services for vector data and Catalog Services for the Web for Metadata.

.. revealjs:: Data Stores
    .. rv_note::
        At the bottom of the stack are the databases.

.. revealjs:: Navigation and Maps
    .. rv_note::
        The next category we will look at is Navigation and Maps.

.. revealjs:: Spatial Tools
    .. rv_note::
        The next category we have grouped together are Spatial Tools.

.. revealjs:: Domain Specific GIS
    .. rv_note::
        In this section, we have grouped applications targeted at a specific domain.

.. revealjs:: Data
    .. rv_note::
        Of course, all these free tools become much more useful with access to free mapping data.

.. revealjs:: Geospatial Libraries
    .. rv_note::
        We will now look at key libraries which have shown a level of quality by going through the OSGeo Incubation process.

        As you can see listed here, many people have been involved in packaging the Open Source Software for OSGeo-Live, and literally thousands of developers have helped build the software we package. Thank you. I'd like to especially the Project Steering Committee who have led the coordination and core packaging of the OSGeo-Live project.

.. revealjs:: Questions?
    .. rv_note::
        This has just been a taster, do you want to know more? You can see project descriptions or download the OSGeo-Live DVD from the website. The OSGeo Foundation provides links to all things GeoSpatial and Open Source. There are many conferences worth attending, in particular the annual FOSS4G conference. And in Australia and New Zealand, Jirotech provide commercial support and training courses for GeoSpatial Open Source.
