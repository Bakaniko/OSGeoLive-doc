            As you can see listed here, many people have been involved in packaging the Open Source Software for OSGeo-Live,
            and literally thousands of developers have helped build the software we package.
            Thank you.
            I'd like to especially the Project Steering Committee who have led the coordination and core packaging of the OSGeo-Live project.
