        .. image:: ../images/projects/osgeolive/osgeolive_menu.png

    .. revealjs:: Components on OSGeoLive

        * 50+ Open Source Geospatial Applications.
        * Sample Datasets.
        * Consistent Overviews & Quickstarts.
        * Translations.


        .. rv_note::
            Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit 's' on your keyboard).

    .. revealjs:: DVD / USB / Virtual Machine

        .. rv_note::
            OSGeoLive can also be run from a DVD, USB flash drive, installed into a Virtual Machine, or installed onto your hard drive.
            This presentation provides a lightning overview of all applications installed on OSGeoLive, which effectively gives you a birds eye view of the breadth of robust GeoSpatial Open Source Software available.

    .. revealjs:: Quality Criteria

        * Established, stable, working software
        * Active community
        * `Metrics <https://live.osgeo.org/en/metrics.html>`__

        .. image:: ../images/presentation/metrics.png
            :height: 400

        .. rv_note::
            OSGeoLive helps new users quickly find quality GIS applications from the myriads of options.
            OSGeoLive only accepts established open source projects, and users can then verify the application works by running it on OSGeoLive.
            This slide shows the OpenHUB metrics page, which shows the community size and activity.

    .. revealjs:: Production & Marketing Pipeline

        .. image:: ../images/presentation/pipeline.png
            :height: 400

        .. rv_note::
            * OSGeoLive provides a production and marketing pipeline, providing value to a whole range of user groups.
            * Developers who package and support testing of their applications on OSGeoLive get their applications marketed at conferences, workshops and on the web.
            * Document writers get their documentation reviewed, translated into multiple languages and published.
            * Translators are provided with quality source documentation, and a publish through OSGeo web pages.
            * Conference organisers welcome presentations which explain the breadth of Geospatial Open Source, often having a VIP present a derivative of the OSGeoLive during keynote presentations, and adding value to delegates by giving away an OSGeoLive DVD or USB.
            * Geospatial educators and workshop presenters use the stable OGeo-Live Virtual Machine or USB for practical class room settings.
            * Which all leads to Architects and Developers discovering, and then incorporating Open Source Geospatial software in their projects.

    .. revealjs:: Reboot for 11.0</h2>

        * Reduced scope of OSGeoLive 11.0 release
        * Reviewed all projects, focusing on quality of documentation
        * Rebaselined to focus on leading applications
        * Dropped:

          * Windows-only applications/installers
          * Overviews of OGC Standards
          * Quickstarts of Libraries
          * Some applications that did not meet our review criteria

        * Only support a 64 bit distribution (32 bit is built but not officially supported)

        .. rv_note::

            In OSGeoLive Version 11.0 no new projects were included. We reduced our scope in order to meet the level of effort provided by our volunteers.

        .. rv_note::
            * Open Source applications have a reputation for excellent standards compliance. Notably, the OGC uses Open Source projects when defining reference implementations for standards.
            * OSGeoLive includes overviews of some of the key OGC standards in simple language so they can be understood by people without a technical background.
            * Building Spatial Data Infrastructures using standards, facilitates interoperability between proprietary and open source applications.
            * It facilitates sharing data between agencies.
            * It reduces long term costs associated with data maintenance,
            * and it reduces long term project risk by avoiding dependence upon proprietary formats or products, thus avoiding vendor lock-in.

    .. revealjs:: QGIS

        .. image:: ../images/projects/qgis/qgis_screenshot.png
           :height: 600

        .. rv_note::
            Quantum GIS, or QGIS, is a very popular user-friendly GIS client which allows you to visualize, manage, edit, analyse data, and compose printable maps.
            It supports numerous vector, raster and database formats, and boasts many free toolboxes, including a user-friendly interface to many of the advanced GRASS analysis modules.


    .. revealjs:: GRASS GIS

        .. image:: ../images/projects/grass/grass_screenshot.png
           :height: 600

        .. rv_note::
            GRASS GIS provides powerful raster, vector, and geospatial processing.
            It includes tools for spatial modeling, visualization of raster and vector data, management and analysis of geospatial data, and the processing of satellite and aerial imagery.
            It also provides the capability to produce sophisticated presentation graphics and hardcopy maps.
            It includes over 400 built-in analysis modules and 100 community supplied modules and toolboxes.
            With over 30 years of continuous development, GRASS is both the oldest and largest Open Source GIS available.
            It is capable of very powerful analysis, but may not be as simple to get started with as other offerings with more of a geodata viewer focus.
            Many Open Source projects make use of GRASS's algorithms.

    .. revealjs:: gvSIG

        .. image:: ../images/projects/gvsig/gvsig_screenshot.png
           :height: 600

        .. rv_note::
            In 2003, the Ministry for Transport and Infrastructure in Valencia, Spain, started migrating all their systems to Open Source Software.
            Part of this migration involved the development of gvSIG to replace ESRI desktop applications in use.
            gvSIG is a desktop GIS application designed for capturing, storing, handling, analysing and deploying any kind of referenced geographic information in order to solve complex management and planning problems.
            gvSIG is available in over 20 languages, and has a very strong following amongst Spanish speakers

    .. revealjs:: OpenJUMP

        .. image:: ../images/projects/openjump/openjump_screenshot.png
           :height: 600

        .. rv_note::
            OpenJUMP is a spin-off from the original JUMP project, which was Open Source but didn't accept improvements and updates from the community.
            This resulted in over 10 forks of the original code base. OpenJUMP provided a merging back together of many of these forks. 
            OpenJUMP is an easy to use and powerful deskstop GIS that enables users to edit, analyse, and display geographic data.
            It is particularly good at conflation, which involves aligning a feature which is shown in different locations on two different map layers.

            QGIS Server provides a web map service based on the popular QGIS desktop application.
            The close integration with QGIS means desktop maps can easily be exported to web maps by copying the QGIS project file into the server directory,
            and a nice touch is that the web maps look exactly the same as they do in the desktop.

            The 52°North WPS is a java-based Web Processing Service which provides web access to geospatial processing algorithms provided by Sextane, ArcGIS Server, GRASS or custom developed functions.
            Algorithms may be as simple as determining the difference in influenza cases between two different seasons, or as complicated as a global climate change model.
