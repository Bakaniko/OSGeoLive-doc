.. Writing Tip: Overview section
 This section is required and has no heading. Start with a sentence describing what the application is and does. Start with a sentence describing what the application is and does. Next, describe what will be covered in the Quick Start. Mention any prerequisites that are required to complete the Quickstart, for example, internet connection or data to test with.

Start application name
======================
.. Writing Tip:
  The heading title for the first section is "Start application name". Use Sphinx inline markup :menuselection: for selecting the application from the Start menu. If there is more than one step to get running with the application, use numbered steps. If it is only one step, use sentence format.

From the Start menu, choose :menuselection:`Geospatial --> Desktop GIS --> uDig`. The application will take a few moments to start up.

   :scale: 70 %

.. Writing Tip:
  Optionally, include a screenshot here of the UI. Use a scale of 50% from a 1024x768 display (preferred) or 70% from a 800x600 display. Markup the graphic with red circles to highlight any particular areas of note on the GUI (if required).
  Store images here:

Procedure
=========
 
.. Writing Tip: Use numbered steps to describe what to do (the hash symbol renders numbered steps). Steps start with a verb or action word. 
   Include only one action per step. 
   A description of the expected result is not a new step. Use Sphinx inline markup such as :guilabel: for buttons and field names; and :menuselection: for selecting menu items. Also refer to this page to describe elements on the UI https://developers.google.com/style/ui-elements
   Use sub-headings for nested procedures if required. Use code blocks to describe interactions with the command line.

.. Writing Tip: Note are optional. You can use them to provide descriptions and background information without getting in the way of instructions.

.. Writing Tip: Tips are optional. You can use them to provide extra information or other ways of performing an action like keyboard shortcuts or drag and drop.

.. tip:: You can also drag and drop shapefiles directly into the application.

Things to try
================================================================================
.. Writing tip:
 This section is optional. Suggest one or several activities for people to try out on their own. It could be something very specific that is easily achievable, or it could be a bit of a challenge that involves a small bit of research (limited to something that can be found in documentation packaged on OSGeoLive.

Here are some additional challenges for you to try:

* Try Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 
* Mauris eget dui vitae estsodales consequat eget vel risus.
* Try Praesent pretium mauris id porta convallis.
