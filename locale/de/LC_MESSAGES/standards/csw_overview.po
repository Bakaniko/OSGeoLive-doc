"The OGC Catalogue Service interface standard specifies a design pattern "
"for defining interfaces to publish and search collections of descriptive "
"information (metadata) about geospatial data, services and related "
"information objects. Providers of resources, such as content providers, "
"use catalogues to register metadata that conform to the provider's choice"
" of an information model; such models include descriptions of spatial "
"references and thematic information. Client applications can then search "
"for geospatial data and services in very efficient ways."

"ISO 19115/19139 Metadata profile "
"(http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=32557). This "

"for XML encoding per ISO 19139 "
"(http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=32557) and HTTP "
"protocol binding. This CSW profile is widely implemented in Europe, such "
"as in the Spatial Data Infrastructure for North Rhine Westphalia (federal"

"CSW-ebRIM Registry Service. "
"(http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=31137) This profile "
"applies the CSW interfaces to the OASIS ebXML registry information model "
"(ebRIM 3.0) so as to provide a general and flexible web-based registry "
"service that enables users—human or software agents—to locate, access, "
"and make use of resources in an open, distributed system; it provides "
"facilities for retrieving, storing, and managing many kinds of resource "
"descriptions. An extension mechanism permits registry content to be "
"tailored for more specialized application domains."
