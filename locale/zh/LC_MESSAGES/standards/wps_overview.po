"The OGCÂ® Web Processing Service (WPS) Standard describes how to access "
"geospatial processes from a web interface. Processes include any "
"algorithm, calculation or model that operates on spatially referenced "
"vector or raster data. A WPS may offer calculations as simple as "
"subtracting one set of spatially referenced numbers from another (e.g., "
"determining the difference in influenza cases between two different "
"seasons), or as complicated as a global climate change model.  "
