"1) Get some data from your GPS device. There are a couple ways to do "
"this, a suitable GPX file containing a couple of tracks can be found on "
"the disc at :file:`~/data/vector/R/test_trk2.gpx`."

"2) Open up Viking and use :menuselection:`File --> Open` to open the GPX "
"file. Viking will try to change its viewing area to the center of the "
"layer (file) but sometimes if you have waypoints and tracks which are "
"very far apart you won't see anything. If this is the case, expand the "
"layer (on the Layers Panel to the left), then expand \"Waypoints\", find "
"a waypoint and right-click on it and click \"Goto\". You can pan by "
"dragging the map canvas with the left or middle mouse buttons, and zoom "
"in and out with the mouse wheel."

"3) Now add a map layer (:menuselection:`Layers --> New Map Layer`), to "
"begin with *OpenStreetMap (Mapnik)* is a good place to start as they have"
" good coverage for much of the planet. Next choose a suitable cache "
"directory where you would like to store your downloaded maps, the default"
" is fine. Adjust the alpha slider if you would like to change the "
"transparency level of the map layer, and tick the `Autodownload map` "
"check box. You can always manually download maps later from the "
":menuselection:`Tools --> Maps Download` menu if you are not currently "
"online. Finally, to keep the map scale at a comfortable level regardless "
"of the current map zoom, set the `Zoom level` to *Use Viking Zoom Level*."

"4) You will notice the map tiles are being drawn on top of the tracks, "
"which is probably not what you want. Look at the Layers Panel to the "
"left. Notice how the layer named \"Map\" is ABOVE the Track/Waypoint "
"layer that your GPS data is in. This means that it will be drawn last, or"
" on top of the other layers. Select the *Map* layer from the list and "
"click the down arrow button beneath the list. Now your tracks will be "
"drawn over the map."
