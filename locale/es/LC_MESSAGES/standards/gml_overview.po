"GML (http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/gml) is an XML grammar "
"defined to express and communicate geographical features. GML serves as a"
" modeling language for geographic systems as well as an open interchange "
"format for geographic transactions on the Internet. Note that the concept"
" of feature in GML is a very general one and includes not only "
"conventional \"vector\" or discrete objects, but also coverages and some "
"elements of sensor data. The ability to integrate all forms of geographic"
" information is key to the utility of GML."
