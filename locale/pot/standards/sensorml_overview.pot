msgid "The OGC Sensor Model Language (SensorML) Encoding Standard describes an information model and XML encodings that enable discovery and tasking of Web-resident sensors as well as exploitation of sensor observations. Within this context, SensorML allows the developer to define models and XML Schema for describing any process, including measurement by a sensor system, as well as post-measurement processing.
