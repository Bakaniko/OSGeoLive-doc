An excellent example of using a WFS service to provide open and interoperable access to large amounts of geospatial content via a government portal is the USGS Framework Web Feature Services offered in support of the development of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) (http://frameworkwfs.usgs.gov/). Selected US Framework map layers are available as WFS layers and also available through a browser interface provided by the USGS."
