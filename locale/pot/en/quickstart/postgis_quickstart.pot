msgid "PostgreSQL, like many databases, works as a server in a client-server system. The client makes a request to the server and gets back a response. This is the same way that the internet works - your browser is a client and a web server sends back the web page. With PostgreSQL the requests are in the SQL language and the response is usually a table of data from the database."
