msgid "Let's create a map of Europe with an indication of the 2013 FOSS4G conference. First we'll initialize the map and set its view to our chosen geographical coordinates and a zoom level:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../quickstart/leaflet_quickstart.rst:58
msgid "By default (as we didn't pass any options when creating the map instance), all mouse and touch interactions on the map are enabled, and it has zoom and attribution controls."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../quickstart/leaflet_quickstart.rst:60
msgid "Note that setView call also returns the map object - most Leaflet methods act like this when they don't return an explicit value, which allows convenient jQuery-like method chaining."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../quickstart/leaflet_quickstart.rst:62
msgid "Next we'll add a tile layer to add to our map. In this case we will be using the tile images provided by TileStache on the live dvd. Note that using nicer background maps such as openstreetmap will result in a much better user experience."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../quickstart/leaflet_quickstart.rst:65
msgid "Creating a tile layer usually involves setting the URL template for the tile images, the attribution text and the maximum zoom level of the layer:"

msgid "Make sure all the code is called after the **div** and **leaflet.js** inclusion. That's it! You have a working Leaflet map now."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../quickstart/leaflet_quickstart.rst:82
msgid "It's worth noting that Leaflet is provider-agnostic, meaning that it doesn't enforce a particular choice of providers for tiles, and it doesn't even contain a single provider-specific line of code, so you're free to use other providers if you need to."

msgid "Adding a circle is the same (except for specifying the radius in meters as a second argument), but lets you control how it looks by passing options as the last argument when creating the object:"

msgid "Working with popups"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../quickstart/leaflet_quickstart.rst:118
msgid "Popups are usually used when you want to attach some information to a particular object on a map. Leaflet has a very handy shortcut for this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../quickstart/leaflet_quickstart.rst:127
msgid "Here we use **openOn** instead of **addTo** because it handles automatic closing of a previously opened popup when opening a new one which is good for usability."

msgid "Dealing with events"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../quickstart/leaflet_quickstart.rst:132
msgid "Every time something happens in Leaflet, e.g. user clicks on a marker or map zoom changes, the corresponding object sends an event which you can subscribe to with a function. It allows you to react to user interaction:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../quickstart/leaflet_quickstart.rst:142
msgid "Each object has its own set of events - see documentation_ for details. The first argument of the listener function is an event object - it contains useful information about the event that happened. For example, map click event object (e in the example above) has latlng property which is a location at which the click occured."

#: ../../../quickstart/leaflet_quickstart.rst:144
msgid "Lets improve our example by using a popup instead of an alert:"
