msgid "**View**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../quickstart/openlayers_quickstart.rst:32
msgid "The *view* determines how the map is rendered. It is used to set the resolution, the center location, etc. It is like a camera through which we look at the map's content."

msgid "**Layers**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../quickstart/openlayers_quickstart.rst:35
msgid "*Layers* can be added to the map in a stacked order, that is, lower layers are rendered before upper layers.  Layers can be either *raster layers* (images), or *vector layers* (points/lines/polygons)."

msgid "**Source**"

#: ../../../quickstart/openlayers_quickstart.rst:38
