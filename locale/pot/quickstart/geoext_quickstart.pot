msgid "GeoExt is a JavaScript library that runs in the browser, it combines and enhances the ExtJS framework and OpenLayers library. This quick start details the steps to create a rich web application using GeoExt components in less than 200 lines of code. We will be using the installed MapServer web services on OSGeoLive a MapServer to supply map layers to the application. Completing the steps below will result in the demo GeoExt application at http://localhost/geoext/."
