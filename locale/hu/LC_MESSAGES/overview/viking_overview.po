"`Viking <http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/viking/>`_ is a GPS data "
"editor, analyzer and viewer. Viking aims to be easy to use, yet powerful "
"in accomplishing a wide variety of GPS related tasks. It uses a "
"hierarchical layering system to organize GPS data, maps, and other layer "
"types with spatial data, such as coordinate lines. It works with "
":doc:`OpenStreetMap <osm_dataset_overview>` data and various online tile "
"servers."
