"The OGC KML Encoding Standard is an XML language focused on geographic "
"visualization, including annotation of maps and images. Geographic "
"visualization includes not only the presentation of graphical data on the"
" globe, but also the control of the userâ€™s navigation in the sense of "
"where to go and where to look. "

"In 2006, Google submitted KML (formerly Keyhole Markup Language) to the "
"OGC for consideration as a standard. KML was the first instance of a de-"
"facto standard being submitted into the OGC standards process and as such"
" the OGC modified our standards approval process to accommodate standards"
" that have been developed externally from the OGC and then submitted into"
" the OGC process. There were four objectives for this standards work:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../standards/kml_overview.rst:43
msgid ""
"That there be one international standard language for expressing "
"geographic annotation and visualization on existing or future web-based "
"online maps (2d) and earth browsers (3d). That KML be aligned with "
"international best practices and standards, thereby enabling greater "
"uptake and interoperability of earth browser implementations. That the "
"OGC and KML community will work collaboratively to insure that the KML "
"implementer community is properly engaged in the process and that the KML"
" community is kept informed of progress and issues. That the OGC process "
"will be used to insure proper life-cycle management of the KML candidate "
"specification, including such issues as backwards compatibility."

"KML was approved as an OGC standard in 2008 because the Membership "
"believed that having KML as an OGC standard would encourage broader "
"implementation and greater interoperability and sharing of earth browser "
"content and context."

msgid ""
"KML is complementary to most of the existing OGC specifications including"
" key standards such as GML (Geography Markup Language), WFS (Web Feature "
"Service) and WMS (Web Map Service). Currently, KML (v2.1) utilizes "
"certain geometry elements derived from GML (version 2.1.2). These "
"elements include point, line-string, linear-ring, and polygon."
