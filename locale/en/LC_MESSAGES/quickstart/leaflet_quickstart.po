"Leaflet is a JavaScript library for browser-based, mobile-friendly, "
"interactive maps.  It is lightweight, yet has all the features most "
"developers ever need for online maps. Leaflet is designed with "

"It's worth noting that Leaflet is provider-agnostic, meaning that it "

"Each object has its own set of events - see documentation_ for details. "
