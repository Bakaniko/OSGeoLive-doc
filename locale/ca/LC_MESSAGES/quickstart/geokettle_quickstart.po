"GeoKettle is a “spatially-enabled” version of Pentaho Data Integration (also"
" known as Kettle). It is a powerful, metadata-driven spatial ETL (Extract, "
"Transform and Load) tool dedicated to the integration of different data "
"sources for building and updating geospatial databases, data warehouses and "
"web services."

"data into a target DataBase Management System (DBMS), GIS file, or "
"geospatial web service. GeoKettle is particularly useful for automating "
"complex and repetitive data processing without producing specific code, "
