"As a short introduction to SAGA vector capabilities, we will now generate"
" Contour Lines from the digital elevation model. This can be done by "
"using the **Shapes - Grid | Contour Lines From Grid** if you open the "
"tools tab in the manager, or you can equally well open the module using "
"the menu: **Geoprocessing|Shapes|Grid|Vectorization**. Choose your grid "
"system and grid (this has to be the elevation). You can leave the options"
" as they are, but perhaps it is better to choose an equidistance of 50m "
"instead of the standard 10m. A few seconds later your contour map has "
"been generated and you should find it back under the data tab in the "
"workspace. Try opening your contour map in a new map. All contour lines "
"now have the same colour, which is not that attractive. If you select "
"your data set (in the workspace, data tab) and check the Settings in the "
"Object Properties window, you can find a section: Display: color "
"classification. You can change the classification from 'Unique symbol' to"
" graduated color. Then you should still adjust the attribute which is "
"used for this graduated color to the elevation. Press apply, and you are "
"presented with coloured contour lines."
