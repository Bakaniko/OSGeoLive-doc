"The OGC Sensor Observation Service (SOS) Interface Standard is a data "
"service. The OGC SOS standard defines a standardized interface and "
"operations for access to observations from sensors and sensor systems "
"that is consistent for all sensor systems including remote, in-situ, "
"fixed and mobile sensors. SOS provides query results in the Observation "
"and Measurements (O&M) standard format for modeling sensor observations "
"and the SensorML specification for modeling sensors and sensor systems. "
